        <li>Preheat oven to 375°. Grease a 13"x9" baking dish with butter. 
            In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook macaroni, stirring occasionally, 
            until al dente, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt 1 stick butter. Sprinkle flour over and cook,
